# Brain-MRI-tumor-segmentation ðŸ§ 
Medical image processing is the most challenging and emerging field nowadays. Processing of MRI images is one of the part of this field. This paper describes the proposed strategy to detect brain tumors; to extract them from patientâ€™s MRI scan images of the brain. This method incorporates with some noise removal functions (the anisotropic in this specific case), segmentation and morphological operations which are the basic concepts of image processing. 
Detection and extraction of tumour from MRI scan images of the brain is done by using MATLAB software and functions.
